    <h2>Weather in details</h2>
    <p>The weather today was really nice. It wasn’t too hot or too cold just perfect. The sun was shining gently, and there was a light breeze that made it feel fresh and calm. The sky was clear and blue, and everything felt peaceful. It was the kind of day that made you want to go outside, take a walk, or just enjoy the air.</p>
