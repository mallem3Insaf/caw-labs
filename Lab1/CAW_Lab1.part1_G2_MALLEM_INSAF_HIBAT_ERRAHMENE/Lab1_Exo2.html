    <p>Gaza has suffered a catastrophic human toll since 7 October 2023. According to consolidated reporting cited by Al Jazeera (700-day review published 5–6 Sept 2025), the conflict has produced 64,232 martyrs and 161,583 injured people. Among the dead are 19,424 children (about 30.2% of reported fatalities) and 10,138 women; the reporting also notes thousands of elderly casualties and large numbers of medical personnel, civil-defence workers and journalists among the dead. These figures come from official Palestinian counts compiled and published in media summaries and by health-sector reporting platforms.</p>

    <p>The scale of family- and community-level loss is especially severe: official tallies cited in the same report indicate that more than 38,000 families have suffered massacres, over 2,613 families were completely wiped out from civil-registration records (a total of 7,563 individuals), and more than 5,943 families were reduced to a single survivor (11,901 victims). The report also states that roughly 9,500 people are still listed as missing, either trapped under rubble or otherwise unaccounted for. These human-level statistics underline the widespread and multi-generational nature of the losses across Gaza.</p>
    <p>Material and infrastructure damage has been enormous and is described in the Al Jazeera compilation as reaching a level of near-total devastation in many sectors. The government media office estimated 125,000 tonnes of explosives were dropped on Gaza and put overall direct losses at more than US$68 billion (a preliminary estimate). Specific sectoral impacts reported include destruction or severe damage to over 210,000 housing units (with 110,000 uninhabitable and 180,000 partly damaged), the total or partial destruction of hundreds of schools and universities (156 fully destroyed; 382 partially), and severe damage to the health system (including 38 hospitals and 96 health centres reportedly taken out of service, and dozens of ambulances and civil-defence vehicles destroyed). Religious, cultural and burial sites were also heavily affected.</p>

    <p>Finally,     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.6dP1vUWzYbh6hlonY1YGjwHaE7?w=249&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=7&cb=12&pid=1.7&rm=3" alt="destruction in palestine by moataz azaiza">
those seeking primary, ongoing health-sector records and official incident reports can consult the Palestinian Ministry of Health / Sehatty platform, which hosts reporting tools for martyrs, injured, buried bodies and other health-system updates — the site is used as an authoritative channel for registering casualties and health-sector impacts. For publication dates and the context of the tallies above, note that the Al Jazeera summary was published on 5–6 September 2025 and aggregates figures provided by Palestinian official sources; numbers may be revised by authorities as new information becomes available.</p>
